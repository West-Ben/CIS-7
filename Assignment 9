2.2 Exercise 3:  
1) Prove by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)
  n = 1
  (4-3 = 2-1) <=> (1 = 1) 
  assume k is true; show k + 1 is true
  k(2k-1) + (4k+4-3) = (k+1)(2k+2-1)
	2k^2-k + 4K+1 = 2k^2+3k+1		2k+1  
	2k^2 + 3k + 1 = 2k^2 + 3k + 1

2) Prove that for any positive integer number n, n^3 + 2n is divisible by 3			
  (n^3 + 2n) = 3(m)
  n^3 = 3m - 2n
  n+1^3 + 2n+2 = 3m 
  (n+1)(n+1)(n+1)
  (n^2 + 2n + 1)(n + 1)
  n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 + 2n + 2
  3m - 2n + 3n^ + 5n + 3
  3m + 3n^2 + 3n + 3
  3(m+n^2+n+1) = 3k; k = (m+n^2+n+1)
  
  
  
  

3) Prove that for n >= 1, 9^n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by 8 for all non-negative integers
		Hint: 4^(3+1) = 4 * 4^3
		Hint: If 9^n - 1 = 8m, then 9^n = 8m + 1  
    
    9^n - 1 = 8m
    9^(n+1) - 1
    (9 * 9^n) - 1
    9(8m + 1) - 1
    9*8m + 9 - 1
    9*8m + 8
    8(9m + 1) = 8k; k = (9m+1)
