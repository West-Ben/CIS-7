#35:
  repeat
    i=1
    read a value for x
    if ((x <5.0) and (2x <10.7)) or (sqrt(5x) > 5.1) then
      write the value of x

  input = 1.0, 5.1, 2.4, 7.2, and 5.3; what are output values?
  output = 1.0, 2.4, 7.2, 5.3
  
  #37: a= (v1 < v2) b= (odd(n))
    ( a ∨ b )' ∨ (a' ^ b)
    a' ^ b' ∨  (a' ^ b)
    a' ^ (b' v a') ^ (b' v b)
    a' ^ (b' v a') ^ T
    a' ^ T
  
  #38:
    (a ^ b)' ^ c
   
   does this output statement a? Yes, A = false, B = false, (A ^ B)' = true,  C = true, so  it exectutes statement 1
  
  #61: Percival is telling the truth " at least one" would be a true statement.
  Since Percival is telling the truth then Llewellyn must be the liar.
  percival = A; Llewellyn = B;
  if (A ∨ B) if statement is false
  since A is true then the statement is true.
  
  #62: Merlin = A; Meredith = B;
    if (A -> B)
    statement is only false if Merlin is a truth teller and Meredith is not.
    
    if Merlin is a truth teller and Meredith is a truth teller then the statement is true and that means
    that they are both truth tellers.
  
  #63: if (A ∨ B)
  Rothwold is a truth teller, the statement he makes is true whether he is a liar of not.
  therefore Rothworld is the truth teller and Grymlin is a truth teller since the statement is true.
  
  #64: (A ^ B) statement = ( T ^ F) = F
  this statment can't be true because if it was then Gwendolin would be the liar.
  therefore since Gwendolin is a liar then Merrilaine must also be the liar because that means that,
  "but Merrilaine is not," is the lie.
