  c)  the degree of seperation is 2
  
(13)  'b' is not isomorphic because all its nodes a degree of 2
where as the other graphs have 2 nodes of degree 2 and one node of degree 0
  
(30)  4-12-2 = -r => -4+12+2 = (r = 10)

(49)  A graph who's nodes all have arcs that connect to themselves, the matrix shows 1s that are in a straight diagonal direction
(50)  A graph that has nodes that are all isolated, the matrix will have all 0s
(51)  The graph will have nodes that are all connected to each other node but not to themselves, the Matrix will look like all 1s
      except for a straight diagonal of 0s

(71) The adjacency matrix will for graph G' will have 0s where there are 1s in graph G,
then G' will have 1s where there were 0s in graph G
