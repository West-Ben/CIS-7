   does this output statement a? Yes, A = false, B = false, ~(A ^ B) = true, -> C = true, so it executes a
  
  #61: Percival is telling the truth " at least one" would be a true statement.
  Since Percival is telling the truth then Llewellyn must be the liar.
  percival = A; Llewellyn = B;
  if (A ∨ B) 
  since A is true then the statement is true.
  
  #62: Merlin = A; Meredith = B;
    if (A -> B)
    statement is only false if Merlin is a truth teller and Meredith is not.
    
    if Merlin is a truth teller and Meredith is a truth teller then the statement is true and that means
    that they are both truth tellers.
  
  #63: if (A ∨ B)
  Rothwold is a truth teller, the statement he makes is true whether he is a liar of not.
  therefore Rothworld is the truth teller and Grymlin is a truth teller since the statement is true.
  
  #64: (A ^ B)
  this statment can't be true because if it was then Gwendolin would be the liar.
  therefore since Gwendolin is a liar then Merrilaine must also be the liar because that means that,
  "but Merrilaine is not," is the lie.
