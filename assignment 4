1) Show that p->q and q' -> p' are logically equivalent without using truth tables or a "contrapositive" law (don't assume they are true)
  p->q 
  = p' v q              (Implication)
  = q v p'              (Commutative)
  = q' -> p'            (Implication)
  
2) Show that (p->r) ^ (q->r) <=> (p v q) -> r

= (p' v r) ^ (q' v r)   (Implication)
= (r v p') ^ (r v q')   (Commutative)
= r v (p' ^ q')         (Distribution)
= r v (p v q)'          (De Morgans Law)
= (p v q)' v r          (Commutative)
= (p v q) -> r          (Implication)


3) Come up with 2 more questions like the ones above. Incorporate the logic laws we discussed in class. Your questions will be used in the next class' lab

(p v r')  <=> (r' -> p')

r' v p    (Commutative)
r -> p    (Implication)
r' -> p'  (Contraposition)


(q -> p) ^ q <=> p

q' v p ^ q  (Implication)
p v q' ^ q  (Commutative)
p v q ^ q'  (Commutative)
q v p,q'    (Simplification)
p           (Disjunction syllogism)
